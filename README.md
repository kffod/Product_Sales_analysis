## Introduction

In this project, we use Jupyter Notebook to analyze sales data. By leveraging the power of Matplotlib and Seaborn, we create informative visualizations that help in understanding sales performance over time, identifying key trends, and making data-driven decisions.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to set up your environment with the necessary libraries. Follow these steps to install the required packages:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kffod/Product_Sales_analysis.git
    cd Product_Sales_analysis
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the `sales_analysis.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to perform the analysis.

## Data Preparation

Before running the notebook, ensure your sales data is prepared and saved in a CSV file. The notebook expects a CSV file with the following columns:

- `Date`: The date of the sale
- `Product`: The product name
- `Quantity`: The quantity sold
- `Price`: The price of the product
- `Total_Sales`: The total sales amount

Ensure your CSV file is placed in the `data/` directory of the project.

## Visualization Examples

The notebook includes several types of visualizations, such as:

- Time series plots to visualize sales trends over time
- Bar charts to compare sales of different products
- Heatmaps to identify seasonal patterns in sales
- Scatter plots to analyze the relationship between different sales metrics
